A Single-Step Optimization-Based Kinematic Controller for Real-Time Path Tracking of Legged Robots
The function build_setup(S) lets you tweak several parameters, including:
    - sampling time Ts
    - control method
    - solver
    - noise models
    - constraints
    …and more.

Make sure CasADi (https://web.casadi.org/) and the ACADO Toolkit (https://acado.github.io/) are both installed and configured correctly.
If the script doesn’t behave as expected, drop me a line at ndeniz@sinc.unl.edu.ar.
